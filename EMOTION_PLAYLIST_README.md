# Emotion-Based Playlist Feature

## Overview
The emotion detection system now includes a new playlist feature that creates personalized music playlists based on detected emotions. Instead of playing a single song, the system now generates a curated playlist of 6-8 songs that match the user's emotional state.

## New Features

### 1. Emotion-Based Playlist Generation
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/emotions/playlist`
- **Input**: Emotion detected from facial analysis
- **Output**: Curated playlist of 6-8 songs matching the emotion

### 2. Emotion-to-Music Mapping
The system maps each emotion to specific music genres and search terms:

- **Happy**: Upbeat songs, feel-good music, positive vibes, summer hits, dance music
- **Sad**: Melancholy songs, sad ballads, emotional music, heartbreak songs, reflective music
- **Angry**: Intense rock music, powerful songs, aggressive music, metal songs, energetic rock
- **Natural**: Calm relaxing music, ambient music, peaceful songs, nature sounds, meditation music
- **Disgust**: Dark intense music, heavy metal, industrial music, aggressive songs, intense electronic
- **Surprise**: Energetic exciting music, upbeat electronic, dance hits, party music, energetic pop

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **New Button**: "ðŸŽµ Play Emotion Playlist" replaces the single song button
- **Playlist Queue**: Automatically queues multiple tracks for continuous playback
